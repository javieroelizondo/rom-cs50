Simplified Roadmap for CS50 Final Project
v0: Initial Setup
Goal: Set up the foundational structure of the project.
Tasks:

Initialize a Flask app.
Configure SQLite as the database.
Create the users table using SQLAlchemy.
Push the initial code to GitHub.
Why This Matters:
A solid foundation ensures that your project is organized and scalable. Using SQLite simplifies local development, and GitHub provides version control and a professional touch.

v1: Core Backend Features
Goal: Build the core backend functionality.
Tasks:

Implement user authentication:
Registration and login forms.
Password hashing using Flask-Bcrypt.
Add CRUD operations for rig operations:
Create, read, update, and delete rig operations via API endpoints.
Test all endpoints using tools like curl or Postman.
Why This Matters:
User authentication is critical for any web application, and CRUD operations form the backbone of your app's functionality. Testing ensures reliability before moving to the frontend.


v2: Frontend Development
Goal: Build a simple frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Flask templates.
Tasks:

Use Flask's templating engine (Jinja2) to render HTML pages.
Style the frontend with Bootstrap or TailwindCSS for a clean and responsive design.
Add basic forms for:
User registration and login.
Creating and managing rig operations.
Use JavaScript for client-side interactivity (e.g., form validation).
Why This Matters:
A well-designed frontend enhances user experience. Bootstrap/TailwindCSS saves time on styling, and Jinja2 allows seamless integration between the backend and frontend.

v3: Tasks Management  (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED IN V2)
Goal: Add task management functionality.
Tasks:

Implement CRUD operations for tasks:
Allow users to create, view, update, and delete tasks associated with rig operations.
Add basic progress updates for tasks (e.g., status: pending, in-progress, completed).
Display tasks in a table or list format on the frontend.
Why This Matters:
Task management adds depth to your application and demonstrates your ability to handle relationships between entities (e.g., rig operations and tasks).

v4: Deployment and Final Touches
Goal: Deploy the app and polish the UI.
Tasks:

Deploy the backend and frontend to a free hosting platform like Heroku or Render.
Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL if deploying to production.
Polish the UI:
Ensure the app is mobile-friendly.
Add animations or transitions for a better user experience.
Write a README file explaining how to set up and run the project.
Why This Matters:
Deployment showcases your ability to deliver a real-world application. A polished UI and clear documentation leave a lasting impression on evaluators.

Key Adjustments for CS50
Frontend Simplification:
Instead of React, use Flask templates with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bootstrap/TailwindCSS ensures a professional look without excessive effort.
Focus on Core Features:
Prioritize user authentication, rig operations, and task management. Skip advanced features like JWT authentication, pagination, and analytics unless you have extra time.
Deployment:
Use a free hosting platform like Heroku or Render to showcase your project. Include a link to the live app in your README file.
Documentation:
Write a clear and concise README file explaining:
The purpose of the app.
How to set up and run the project locally.
A link to the deployed app.
